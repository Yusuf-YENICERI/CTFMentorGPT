## Why should i use it?

We generally stuck at some steps while solving CTF challenges. We have some choices at that moment like asking someone for help or checking out the writeup. The problem with asking someone for help is there is not always one that can answer our questions and the problem with writeup is that, we directly get the answer which prevents us to sharpen our skills. So what's the solution is to use CTFMentorGPT. We give it the writeup and it helps us with providing hints. That's what it's built for, inshaAllah.

## Choosing the Right Engine üöó

- **gpt-4-turbo**: Ideal for processing CTF write-ups with optimal performance.
- **gpt-3.5-turbo**: The go-to choice for answering questions, balancing efficiency with cost considerations.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note ‚ö†Ô∏è

While gpt-4-turbo excels in processing CTF write-ups, please be mindful of cost implications. For answering questions, consider using gpt-3.5-turbo to strike the right balance.
The UI for CTFMentorGPT is inspired by and modified from [ChatGPT](https://github.com/PrasadBroo/ChatGPT).
